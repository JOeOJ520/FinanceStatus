# Supervised Learning Classification - Statistical Learning on Self-Assessed Health Status
## Disclaimer
This project is an improvement of the final project of the upper-year Statistic course "Statistical Learning - Classification" at the University of Waterloo by Bolun Cui and Joe Liang.

## Background
The dataset in this project corresponds to the responses in the [German General Social Survey (ALLBUS)](https://www.gesis.org/en/allbus/allbus-home/general-information) between 2005 and 2019. The target variable for machine learning is the last variable "health". It is an ordinal variable with five categories from 1 to 5 and represents the "self-asset financial health" of each survey response.

There are two parts of the dataset, ”train.csv" and "test.csv". the samples in ”train.csv" include "health" variables, which are used for model training. And "test.csv" does not have the "health" variable, which is used for examining the performance.

The goal of this project is to train a classification model on this dataset to classify survey responses into one of the financial health categories.

### Feature Engineering
During analysis, based on our domain knowledge, we derived a new x-variable: the average living space in m2 per person in the household.
### Random Foresting
- Out of Bag (OOB) samples tuning for number of variables to choice and number of trees

- Importance of variables from OOB (randomly mix each variables to test the decrease in accuracy)
